You must review the `STANDARDS.md`, `README.md`, and `CHECKPOINTS.md` files to get familiar with the project, then when coming up with a solution, consider the following before responding:
- Does this code duplicate functionality present elsewhere
- How does this code integrate with the rest of the codebase
- Are there any potential issues or limitations with this approach?

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, review `REGRESSIONS.md` to ensure that the change does not break any existing functionality.
**IMPORTANT**: Accuracy and completeness are of utmost importance. When clarification is required, ask for it.

Other Notes:
- When running python commands, use the virtual environment at `./venv`
- Python can be found at `./venv/bin/python`
- Run `./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies

Once you are done, respond with the current date and time in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
