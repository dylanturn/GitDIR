   - Binary SHA-1 handling in tree objects

2. Fixed packfile generation:
   - Proper object type and size encoding
   - Correct content compression
   - Pack header with version and object count
   - Accurate SHA-1 checksums

3. Improved reference handling:
   - Added HEAD reference advertisement
   - Proper capability negotiation
   - Consistent object caching
   - Fixed reference ordering

4. Enhanced error handling:
   - Better validation of client requests
   - Proper error responses
   - Improved logging

## [2024-12-06 20:39:01] Configuration Enhancement

**Instructions Given:**
- Make the target directory configurable

**Information Obtained:**
- Need to support command-line configuration
- Should maintain current directory as default

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `gitdir.py` to add:
   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Configurable target directory
   - Configurable port and host
   - Global TARGET_DIR variable
2. Updated `README.md` to document:
   - New configuration options
   - Command-line arguments
   - Usage examples

## [2024-12-06 20:34:15] Testing Implementation

**Instructions Given:**
- Start the Flask server
- Test git clone and ls-files functionality

**Information Obtained:**
- Server successfully started on http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Git clone works (shows empty repository as expected)
- Git ls-files endpoint successfully lists all files in directory

**Changes Made:**
1. Started Flask development server
2. Created test directory for cloning
3. Tested both endpoints:
   - `git clone` command worked with empty repo warning
   - `git ls-files` endpoint returned complete file listing

## [2024-12-06 20:32:39] Virtual Environment Setup

**Instructions Given:**
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install project dependencies

**Information Obtained:**
- Successfully created virtual environment at `./venv`

**Changes Made:**
1. Created Python virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Installed dependencies:
   - Flask 3.0.0
   - Werkzeug 3.0.1
   - And their dependencies

## [2024-12-06 20:30:48] Initial Implementation

**Instructions Given:**
- Implement Flask API endpoints for `git clone` and `git ls-files`
- Ensure compatibility with git clients using Smart HTTP protocol

**Information Obtained:**
- Git clients require specific HTTP protocol implementation
- Need to support git-upload-pack service
- Must use correct MIME types and packet formats

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `requirements.txt` with Flask dependencies
2. Created `gitdir.py` implementing:
   - `/info/refs` endpoint for clone initialization
   - `/git-upload-pack` endpoint for file transfer
   - `/git-ls-files` endpoint for listing files
3. Implemented simplified versions of:
   - Git packfile format
   - Reference listing
   - File content transfer

## [2024-12-06 20:29:32] Documentation Correction

**Instructions Given:**
- Clarify that the project is API-only
- Focus on implementing only `git clone` and `git ls-files` commands

**Information Obtained:**
- Project is a Flask API server, not a web application
- No UI components are needed
- Only two git commands need to be implemented

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `README.md` to:
